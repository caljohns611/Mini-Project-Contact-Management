Hello this is an Overview of the Mini-Project Contact Managment
When you first start the code you will see, "Welcome to the Contact Managment System" and a Menu with a list of options you can choose from.
typing in the number 1 will let you add a contact to a list and it will ask you for an identifier to hold all your information in. Then it will ask for your name, phone, email, and additional information you would like to add.
typing in 2 will let you edit a contact that is in the list by its identifier.
typing in 3 will let you delete any contact you would like with the same you type in identifier that is in the list.
typing in 4 will let you search for a contact by its identifier and display the contact.
typing in 5 will let you display all contacts on the list.
